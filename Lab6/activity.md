# Exercise

Submit the zipped modified workspace at the end of the practical with a PDF containing quantic polynomial equations for each dimension for traveling in between following configurations. Use the following format for the document

Joint Angle | Start Configuration | End Configuration | X dimension ploynomial | Y dimension ploynomial | Z dimension ploynomial
------- | --- | --- | --- |--- |--- 
Joint 1 | 0.2 | 0.2 |
Joint 2 | 0.0 | 0.2 |
Joint 3 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
Joint 4 | 0.0 | 0.0 |
Gripper | 0.1 | 0.0 |
