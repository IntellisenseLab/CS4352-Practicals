# Exercise

Submit the zipped modified workspace at the end of the practical with a PDF containing quantic polynomial equations for each joint for traveling in between following configurations. Use the following format for the document. 


Joint Angle | Start Configuration | End Configuration | Polynomial Function
----------- | --------------------| ----------------- | ---
Joint 1     | 0.0                 | -0.2              |
Joint 2     | 0.0                 | 0.0               |
Joint 3     | 0.0                 | 0.0               |
Joint 4     | 0.0                 | 0.0               |


Note: Modify the jclient.py to get the values of polynomial coefficients (a,b,c,d,e,f) as a print to the terminal and use them to formulate polynomial function
