# CS4352-Practicals

## Introduction

This repository contains practicals designed for the CS4352 - Robotics and Automation module offered by Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Moratuwa. This labwork assumes that the  students have a basic understanding of Robot Operating System (ROS) mainly its internal structure, Publisher-subscriber architecture, Client Server architecture. These topics can be covered by following the [ROS Introduction](https://github.com/IntellisenseLab/ROS-Introduction) webinar series. This series of practicals are designed to support the theroy components taught in the CS4352 lectures and will have complementing activities each week.

## Lab 1

This lab focuses on learning about TF broadcasters & TF listeners and relates to the lecture 02 Pose. This practical is based ion [ROS TF tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials) available in ros.wiki.org. For the ease of development we will be using python as main language.
