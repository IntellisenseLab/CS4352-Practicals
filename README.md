## Introduction

This repository contains practicals designed for the CS4352 - Robotics and Automation module offered by Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Moratuwa. This labwork assumes that the  students have a basic understanding of Robot Operating System (ROS) mainly its internal structure, Publisher-subscriber architecture, Client Server architecture. These topics can be covered by following the [ROS Introduction](https://github.com/IntellisenseLab/ROS-Introduction) webinar series.
