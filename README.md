# CS4352-Practicals

## Introduction

This repository contains practicals designed for the CS4352 - Robotics and Automation module offered by Department of Computer Science and Engineering of University of Moratuwa. This branch contains lab activities directed towards Batch 2016. This work assumes that the  students have a basic understanding of Robot Operating System (ROS) mainly its internal structure, Publisher-subscriber architecture, Client Server architecture. These topics can be covered by following the [ROS Introduction](https://github.com/IntellisenseLab/ROS-Introduction) webinar series. This series of practicals are designed to support the theroy components taught in the CS4352 lectures and will have complementing activities each week.

## Lab 1

This lab focuses on learning about TF broadcasters & TF listeners. This practical is based ion [ROS TF tutorial](http://wiki.ros.org/tf/Tutorials) available in ros.wiki.org.
